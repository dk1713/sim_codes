# Simulation codes organised
Simulation codes for Designing hardware components for trapped-ion-based Quantum computer with Bragg reflectors (tilted Bragg gratings)

NB: 
 - Scripts are generally written with 'compile' in front.
 - 'generate' will generate dataset from numerical simulations.
 - The rest of files are function handles and generally describes what they do in the name.
 - For more detail descriptions, the comments are written inside.

## 01 Uniform tilted Bragg gratings
## 02 2D Arbitrary beam generation with TBG
## 03 3D Arbitrary beam generation with TBG
## 04 3D TBG Cross pump calculations
